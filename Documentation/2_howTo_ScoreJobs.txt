How to run it

From your project folder with your environment active:

python score_jobs.py


Verify scores got written:

sqlite3 jobs.db "SELECT company, title, score FROM jobs ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 15;"

(Optional) Shortlist to a view

If you want a saved shortlist view:

sqlite3 jobs.db "CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS shortlist AS SELECT id, company, title, location, url, posted_at, score FROM jobs WHERE score >= 50 ORDER BY score DESC;"
sqlite3 jobs.db "SELECT * FROM shortlist LIMIT 20;"


If you share your skills (or what you want weighted more), I can tune the MY_SKILLS and weights to match you better.
